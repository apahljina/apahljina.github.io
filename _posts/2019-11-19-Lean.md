title: Primality Testing in Lean
---

In 2013 Microsoft Research released Lean, an interactive theorem prover. This program supports the interaction and construction of mathematical proofs. All mathematicians can appreciate the interconnectivity of concepts and progression of ideas from tangible to abstract. The beauty and the thrill. In computational sense, these concepts and structures need to be defined in code right to their very core. The global Lean community has collaborated to implement known mathematical structures and proofs. At the Australian National University, I was fortunate to undertake a research project supplementing existing primality testing tactics.

Primality tests enable the determination prime numbers. The Lucas-Lehmer Lemma provides a decidable proposition for the Mersenne numbers. My implementation introduces Mersenne numbers to Lean, and attempts to establish the sufficiency condition of the Lemma. This project introduced a new level of rigor to my understanding of mathematical proofs. It is exceptionally challenging to articulate highly abstract concepts in code, and I completed this project with a genuinely new appreciation for the intuition of the human mind.
