Hello and welcome to my page! I am currently a penultimate year student in mathematical sciences and applied data analytics at the Australian National University. This site contains my undergraduate research and interest projects - a timeline and portfolio of my growth and learning in data science. I'm also a keen participant in endurance and navigation sports (as probably evident in the subject matter of my projects). I am always up for an adventure, particularly where data or logisitics may be involved.
