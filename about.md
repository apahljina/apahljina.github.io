Hello and welcome to my page! I'm a penultimate year mathematical sciences and applied data analytics student at the Australian National University. This site contains my undergraduate research and interest projects - a timeline and portfolio of my growth and learning in data science. As probably evident in the subject matter of my projects, I'm also a keen participant in endurance and navigation sports!
